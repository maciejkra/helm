## task
Modify the previous chart to use named objects and
1. use autogenerated name for all templates - **be careful there are 2 deployments and 2 services they have to have a different names!**
2. use autogenerated labels (common labels) and selectors
   1. define a new templates for selectors and labels for different services and deployments

* does name change of kubernetes objects have impact on the app? :)
